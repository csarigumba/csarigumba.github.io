Welcome to my corner of the internet!

My name is _@cedricsarigumba_ (Sarigumba, Cedric), a software engineer from the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m either spending time with friends, occasionally cycling/training to enjoy outdoors, or playing video games. I also like writing (check out the blog!) about Philosophy specifically Stoicism, programming, or random topics.

Itâ€™s taken a lot of help to get where I am in my career and I want to give back! So expect to see some programming tutorials here in the future.

Stay fresh,

Ced
